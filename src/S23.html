    <!-- What i did -->
    <div class="container text-center">
        <h1 class="display-6 fw-bold">What I did</h1>
        <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
            <p class="lead mb-4">Within the MTO I was in the Digital Solutions Branch on the Carrier and Finance Product
                Delivery Team. The Digital Solutions Branch maintains the safe and efficient use of roads by providing
                driver licensing, services and vehicle registration. During my work term I was on the midtier
                development team as a part of a major modernization project to modernize and replace outdated
                technology. Known as TSTx Phase 3 the continued modernization is focused on transforming the most used
                public services to make them simpler, better, and more accessible to all Ontarians. Phase 3 is focused
                on the governments driver and vehicle lines of business.</p>
            <p class="lead mb-4">I was on a project developing a web-application to support ServiceOntarios
                vision of a customer-centric service delivery model by
                improving the usability of the services and enhancing the user interfaces. Currently, it is an old
                greenscreen application that is directly calling the mainframe. I worked on the midtier which will sit
                between a new front-end and the existing mainframe backend which will make it easier and faster for
                ServiceOntario staff to serve Ontarians.</p>
            <p class="lead mb-4">The midtier team oversees developing endpoints using Java and Spring Boot. These API
                routes would convert the JSON body of a request into the corresponding XML to forward to the old
                mainframe system which will still be used. Then when the mainframe responds it is converted from XML
                back to JSON and returned to the client. During my term I developed multiple routes, did model builds,
                and updated test files. I used Java, Spring Boot, JUnit, Postman, Azure DevOps, and Git.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3 class="fs-2 text-body-emphasis">Learn Spring Boot</h3>
                    <p>At the start of my term I was unfamiliar with Spring Boot and obviously wanted to become familiar
                        with it to develop REST APIs. I was already familiar with Java and developing
                        web app backends with JavaScript/Node so I hoped that it wouldn't be too hard to pick up.</p>
                    <p>I learned alot about it from multiple walkthroughs that a developer did to teach another intern
                        and I. I also learned by reading some documentation and good old give it a try and search for
                        the things you are trying to accomplish. I worked on a Spring Boot app so over these
                        4-months I had plenty of opportunities to become familiar with it.</p>
                    <p>I accomplished this goal by completing multiple API routes using Spring Boot.</p>

            <div class="col d-flex align-items-start">

                    <svg class="bi" width="1em" height="1em" style="background-color: red;"></svg>

                <div>
                    <h3 class="fs-2 text-body-emphasis">Develop with Relational Databases</h3>
                    <p>I am familiar with relational databases (SQLite) from a class I took and with non-relational
                        databases like DynamoDB and MongoDB, however those were all used for very small academic or
                        personal projects and had simple designs. I made a goal at the start of my internship of working
                        with relational databases in a production or test environment as long as it was a real world
                        scenario.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, the project I was working on did use relational databases but the primary focus of
                        the midtier team was not on storing or manipulating data. That was something the mainframe
                        further in the back was doing. So I did not end up working with databases, but I was fine with
                        that as I learned alot about working in a large team on a project that would actually be used by
                        people.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3 class="fs-2 text-body-emphasis">Learn about Microsoft Azure</h3>
                    <p>I am interested in cloud computing and learning about deploying projects to the cloud. The MTO
                        uses Microsoft Azure for the majority of it's cloud computing needs and the
                        project I was on used Azure for DevOps and CI/CD.</p>
                    <p>To accomplish this goal I wanted to deploy some sort of cloud resource as well as learn more
                        about the different services and products available from most cloud vendors.</p>
                    <p>I achieved this goal by gaining some hands-on experience through Microsoft instructor led Azure
                        training courses. I participated in 2 courses, AZ-900 and AZ-204. AZ-900 is an introductory
                        course with an optional certification that teaches you about the most popular Azure services as
                        well as the pros and cons of cloud computing. Overall it was a great introductory course about
                        cloud computing. The next course was AZ-204 which was much more advanced, it is meant for junior
                        level software developers with some experience with Azure. I joined a week-long course led by
                        two Microsoft instructors. Every day the mornings and early afternoons would be
                        spent on lectures and the afternoons would be to solve labs about the lecture topics.
                        These labs included things like setting up CDN's, Azure Functions, different storage options,
                        and Azure Event Hubs (events/queues).</p>

                    <h3 class="fs-2 text-body-emphasis">Improve Written Communication</h3>
                    <p>Since this was my first internship I wanted to develop good documentation writing skills,
                        especially of technical ideas that can be hard to explain.</p>
                    <p>To accomplish this I wanted to contribute articles to the team wiki and to a less formal notebook
                        about issues people have run into.</p>
                    <p>I achieved this goal. I contributed a wiki article about setting up the development environment
                        in VSCode to run the Spring Boot apps and some common issues I and another intern ran
                        into when getting set up. I also contributed to the team notebook about database connection
                        issues I had and how I fixed it. I contributed some more troubleshooting guides to help future
                        interns and team members. I found it easy to write good(no complaints yet) documentation as I
                        like to write clear notes when I run into issues or get confused, this is because I would forgot
                        what I had already tried when fixing a bug the next day. I also contributed multiple tutorial
                        videos on managing the Azure DevOps board and doing model builds for Java packages.</p>

            <p class="lead mb-4">Overall, I had a great work term. Since this was my first software development job the
                team environment and collaboration was new to me. I learned a lot about software development and met a
                lot of really cool people. I worked on a very interesting project that would directly benefit the
                millions of Ontarians that have a license or a registered vehicle so that was really cool.</p>
