        <h1 class="display-6 fw-bold">What I did</h1>
        <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
            <p class="lead mb-4">I was in a small team responsible for the development and support of a
                a web application used by campaign managers to direct traffic to certain sites and mobile games.
                The web app makes it easier for campaign managers to create campaigns and it also has a bunch of
                features for other company needs.
            </p>
            <p class="lead mb-4">I worked on a web app that makes it easier for campaign managers
                to create and manage their ad campaigns. It provides a suite of features
                that cover a lot of repetitive actions and provides tools to make the marketers more efficient. One such
                tool
                that I worked on was an image text overlayer. It took user provided text and an image then would place
                it over
                the image along with the target site's logo. This image tool also adjusted text wrapping and font
                scaling accordingly. I used PHP and the GD image library to create the image and uploaded them to an S3
                bucket.
            </p>
            <p class="lead mb-4">
                During my term I worked on a lot of tickets that were full-stack features and updates. I wrote
                React/JavaScript for the front-end and PHP for the server. The primary database for the app was MySQL
                so I got a lot of experience writing SQL queries.

                <div>
                    <h3 class="fs-2 text-body-emphasis">Become familiar with PHP</h3>
                    <p>At the start of my term I did not know PHP and obviously needed to learn it to complete tickets.
                        I decided to deem this goal accomplished if I could complete tickets that involved PHP on time
                        and
                        efficiently. The backend of the project I am on is written in PHP and the tickets I have
                        worked on involved writing PHP.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have definitely gained a lot of experience with PHP and developing API endpoints with
                        it. I now have a base of understanding of how PHP works, how it is used when developing
                        web apps, and the best practices to follow when writing PHP. My measure of success for this
                        goal revolved around completing tickets with PHP efficiently and I think I have done that based on feedback from my supervisor.
                        So I can say that I have achieved my goal of becoming familiar with PHP.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col d-flex align-items-start">
                <div
                    class="icon-square text-body-emphasis bg-body-secondary d-inline-flex align-items-center justify-content-center fs-4 flex-shrink-0 me-3">
                    <svg class="bi" width="1em" height="1em" style="background-color: green;"></svg>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3 class="fs-2 text-body-emphasis">Gain experience with relational databases</h3>
                    <p>The project I am on uses MySQL as the database (which is a relational database).
                        So as I work on tickets involving database reading/writing I will gain
                        experience with SQL queries. My measure of success was designing a
                        part of the schema for a table and using it for a feature.</p>
                    <p>I have gained a lot of experience with MySQL
                        since it's the main database system used for the web app I worked on. I designed multiple table
                        schemas that ranged in size
                        and interacted with them with SQL queries that I wrote and made into functions for
                        the backend to use. Therefore, I achieved this goal since I designed and created
                        tables and used them for features that I was building.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="col d-flex align-items-start">

                <div>
                    <h3 class="fs-2 text-body-emphasis">Learn about AWS for production applications</h3>
                    <p>I am interested in cloud computing and learning about deploying projects to the cloud.
                        The company I am working at primarily uses AWS for their applications so my plan was to play a
                        part
                        in the deployment of a feature or creation of a service using AWS.
                    </p>
                    <p>I did not gain experience with AWS or other cloud providers in this role. However, I did learn a
                        little bit about Redis as I completed a ticket that utilized the Redis pipeline feature to make
                        it faster for updating the cache. While the
                        code that I wrote did get hosted on AWS services. I did not provision those services.
                        Since I was on a team that supported a web application that was in production and being
                        used by real users the cloud infrastructure was already set up. In the future this will
                        continue to be a goal of mine.</p>
