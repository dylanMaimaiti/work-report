    <!-- What i did -->
    <div class="container text-center">
        <h1 class="display-6 fw-bold">What I did</h1>
        <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
            <p class="lead mb-4">I was on a team that develops the web application for Magnet Nexus. Nexus is used by companies and government 
                agencies to collect data on company owned employee devices. It's commonly used when a breach occurs or an employee is suspected 
                to be mishandling proprietary company data. There are some very well known companies using the product. There are a few other 
                teams that handle certain parts of the product. This is one of the smaller products and is fairly new. Magnet has older cash cows 
                primarily used by law enforcement and governments.
            </p>
            <p class="lead mb-4">Since the product is well established and has paying customers I worked on a lot of bug fixes and small features. 
                The backend was written in C# and ASP.NET and used DynamoDB and S3 for data storage, no SQL databases. The frontend was written in 
                React and TypeScript. Near the end of my term it was updated to be using Material UI to align with other products the company has. 
                I spent a while poking around the backend and CloudWatch to fix bugs as well as making some changes to a few DynamoDB tables. I did a 
                few tickets with React and TS also fixing bugs and doing some refactoring work.
            </p>
            <p class="lead mb-4">
                This was definitely a different experience then my previous terms, but I enjoyed it. While not as fast paced as other companies it was 
                a good introduction to the development process at large companies. I feel like I gained solid soft skills from communicating with 
                everyone on the team and adjusting to a remote work environment. I did also gain some more technical skills especially in AWS. It was 
                a fulfilling term and I had a great time.

                    <p>I wanted to learn C# and ASP.NET since that's what the backend is written in. 
                        My measure of success was completing at least 5 backend focused tickets.
                    </p>
                    <p>	I've completed more then 5 tickets that required backend changes. Some tickets required 
                        a good amount of new feature work where I learned a lot about C# and ASP.NET. I still 
                        gained a good amount of experience with C# by working on bug fixes in the backend. Those 
                        tickets were tricky and required a lot of poking around and understanding existing logic.

                        My measure of success was completing at least 3 frontend focused tickets.
                    </p>
                    <p>I've completed a lot more then 3 tickets. I worked on bug fixes and some component 
                        refactoring work so I definitely gained experience with TypeScript</p>

                        My measure of success was being able to define 5 terms and participate in 2 ceremonies regularly. 
                        If possible be the facilitator for a sprint.
                    </p>
                    <p>I've learned a little bit more then 5 agile terms and I participated in more then 2 ceremonies regularly. 
                        Every day there was standup and every week there would be some team ceremony that I participated in. 
                        I was also the facilitator of all the agile/ceremony stuff for 2 weeks (a sprint).
