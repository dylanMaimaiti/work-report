    <!-- What i did -->
    <div class="container text-center">
        <h1 class="display-6 fw-bold">What I did</h1>
        <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
            <p class="lead mb-4">I was in a small team responsible for the development and support of a
                a web application used by campaign managers to direct traffic to certain sites and mobile games.
                The web app makes it easier for campaign managers to create campaigns and it also has a bunch of
                features for other company needs. This term I did a lot more backend tickets focused on adjacent 
                software systems that interacted with the web app that I worked on before.
            </p>
            <p class="lead mb-4">Just like last term I worked on a web app that makes it easier for campaign managers
                to create and manage their ad campaigns. It provides a suite of features
                that cover a lot of repetitive actions and provides tools to make the marketers more efficient.
                This term I was given more important features to implement and some of those were CRON jobs that ran 
                on a schedule. I developed a feature that would detect 'bad' users that wouldn't generate revenue when
                they clicked ads. I added some new logic to existing click tracking code and also created new Lambdas, EventBridge rules,
                and S3 buckets which would detect these users and block their IP address from seeing ads for 24 hours using an existing
                MySQL table. 
            </p>
            <p class="lead mb-4">
                I would say about half my tasks were similar to last term (full-stack web dev), but this term was more backend
                and cloud focused, which I really liked. I used React, PHP, and MySQL for the web app. The CRON jobs were also in PHP
                and many required SQL queries. For some new experimental features I got to setup and use some AWS resources that made it
                into production!

        <div class="row g-4 py-5 row-cols-1 row-cols-lg-2">
            <div class="col d-flex align-items-start">
                <div
                    class="icon-square text-body-emphasis bg-body-secondary d-inline-flex align-items-center justify-content-center fs-4 flex-shrink-0 me-3">
                    <svg class="bi" width="1em" height="1em" style="background-color: green;"></svg>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3 class="fs-2 text-body-emphasis">Gain more experience with PHP</h3>
                    <p>I wanted to improve my PHP experience which I planned to do by writing more PHP that is production grade.
                        My measure of success was if my supervisor determined that I had improved my understanding of the language.
                    </p>
                    <p>	I now have another 4 months of PHP experience and so I would deem this goal accomplished.
                        I developed a good amount of backend logic and API endpoints using PHP and now I have a 
                        better understanding of the language. My supervisor also said I accomplished this goal based on 
                        the tickets I worked on.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col d-flex align-items-start">
                <div
                    class="icon-square text-body-emphasis bg-body-secondary d-inline-flex align-items-center justify-content-center fs-4 flex-shrink-0 me-3">

                <div>
                    <h3 class="fs-2 text-body-emphasis">Gain experience with AWS</h3>
                    <p>I wanted to work with AWS in my previous term so this time I wanted to achieve this goal.</p>
                    <p>I have gained a lot of experience with AWS this term so I have definitely accomplished this goal. 
                        This has been a goal of mine since my first internship.
                        This term I setup multiple different resources in AWS as part of multiple features I was 
                        working on. I made multiple new Lambdas written in Python, multiple new Event Rules in 
                        EventBridge, new API Gateway endpoints, and did some configuration of Firehose and 
                        CloudWatch for logging stuff.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col d-flex align-items-start">
                <div
                    class="icon-square text-body-emphasis bg-body-secondary d-inline-flex align-items-center justify-content-center fs-4 flex-shrink-0 me-3">
                    <svg class="bi" width="1em" height="1em" style="background-color: green;"></svg>

                <div>
                    <h3 class="fs-2 text-body-emphasis">Get some professional Python experience</h3>
                    <p>I want some Python experience so this goal is accomplished if I write some Python that makes it's way into production
                    </p>
                    <p>I did accomplish this goal but sort of just barely. The main languages we use are 
                        JavaScript and PHP, Python is not really used here (other than for some cloud and 
                        data stuff). For a feature I needed to setup some AWS Lambda's and our Lambda's are 
                        all written in Python so I wrote a little bit of Python (mostly basic code for 
                        parsing stuff out of a request) which then did go into production. I would have 
                        liked to write some Python that had a bit more logic, but I still think this was 
                        great progress on my goal.</p>
